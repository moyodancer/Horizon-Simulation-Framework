/**
 * A class that specifies the position of a given object in the system in a given coordinate frame.
 * The two coordinate frames used are ECI and LLA. 
 
 * ECI refers to an unchanging coordinate frame which is relatively fixed with respect to the Solar 
 * System. The z axis runs along the Earth's rotational axis pointing North, the x axis points in 
 * the direction of the vernal equinox, and the y axis completes the right-handed orthogonal system.
 * Units are (Kilometers, Kilometers, Kilometers).

 * LLA refers to the geodetic latitude, longitude, and altitude above the planetary ellipsoid. Units
 * are (Radians, Radians, Kilometers)

	 * An object that has a predetermined path on Earth and doesn't change their movement in
	 * response to anything going on in the simulation. Good examples include a train or a boat. 
	 * <B>POSITION_TYPE_PREDETERMINED_ECI<B>
	 * Most space assets will fall under this category. The typical example is a satellite with 
	 * predetermined orbital parameters.
	 * <B>POSITION_TYPE_DYNAMIC_LLA<B>
	 * Things that are capable of varying their position on the Earth in response to events in the
	 * scope of the simulation. These can be assets or targets. A good example would be
	 * a bomber, UAV, tank, infantry group... In this case, the Position object is just a holder
	 * class for the EOMS object, the initial conditions, and the coordinate frame.
	 * <B>POSITION_TYPE_DYNAMIC_ECI<B>
	 * A non-earth object capable of changing it's trajectory. Spacecraft with propulsion, aliens...

	 * conditions, and the coordinate frame.
