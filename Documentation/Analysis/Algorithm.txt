=======================

Algorithm TaskScheduling

Input:  A system with an initial state
        A set of tasks
        A time interval
        The time step length
Output:	A set of schedules

add an empty schedule to the set of schedules
for each quantized point in time
   for each generated schedule
      if the end time of the schedule has not yet passed
         for each task
            if the target of the task is accessible at the systems current position
             and if the task can be added to the schedule
             and if the system can perform the task at the end of the schedule
               add a new schedule with the a new event for the task
return schedules
